# JS-Array Discriminator

JS - have a prompt that feeds an array? 
want to keep the array following some constraints (only letters / only numbers?)
here it is:

I also include an html file so you can test and modify the code around

This is a simple code to create a more discriminating array, at the moment its set so as to gather data about class/course grades, but you can modify it to discriminate on pretty much what you want, you can change the parameters so it takes only letters, or between sets 
of letters, or between sets of numbers etc
